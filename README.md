Mobiletto-driver-b2
===================

This is the Backblaze B2 driver for [mobiletto](https://github.com/cobbzilla/mobiletto).
It's intended to be used with [mobiletto-base](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mobiletto-base) which does not include any drivers.

If you'd prefer a more "batteries included" experience, check out [mobiletto-lite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mobiletto-lite).

See the [mobiletto home page](https://github.com/cobbzilla/mobiletto) for the latest documentation.
