Mobiletto-base
==============

Mobiletto is a JavaScript storage abstraction layer, with optional transparent client-side encryption.

### *this is mobiletto-base*
In order to lighten the weight of this npm package, this branch does not include any drivers or localized translations
of the mobiletto documentation. It otherwise works the same as the regular `mobiletto` software, but because no drivers
are included, you must load the mobiletto storage driver for a given storage type before connecting to storage of that type.

If you'd prefer a more "batteries included" experience, check out [mobiletto-lite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mobiletto-lite).

See the [mobiletto home page](https://github.com/cobbzilla/mobiletto) for the latest documentation.
